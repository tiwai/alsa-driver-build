ALSA branches
=============

master		- just stub with this text

build		- build code (not included to upstream,
		  can touch only alsa/ tree)
mirror		- mirrored code (from upstream)
release		- merged build & mirror trees for packaging

Branch release
==============

Please, use --log for the git merge command to show the "subject" of commits.
It might be handy to define these git aliases in your .git/config file:

[alias]
	bmerge = !git checkout release && git merge --log build
	mmerge = !git checkout release && git merge --log mirror
